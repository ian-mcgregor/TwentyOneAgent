    "# Assignment 3: Twenty Plus One Game\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment asks you to implement an intelligent agent to play the twenty plus one game against one or more adversaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twenty plus one is a \"drinking game\":  before you solve this assignment the course staff would like to remind you to drink responsibly, only if you are over twenty one, and always in moderation. Remember, as a computer scientist you will depend on your brain cells to make a living and Alcohol kills brain cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Twenty Plus One.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(drinking_game)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Rules (Please Read Carefully)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game is played among 2 or more players. \n",
    "- We always assume player number 0 is the intelligent agent. The other players are player numbered $1$, $2$, ..., $n-1$.\n",
    "- The game starts with player 0 and the initial __count__ is at 0.\n",
    "  - The initial direction of play is $+1$. I.e, the the game moves from player 0, followed by 1 and so on until $n-1$. After $n-1$, it wraps around to $0$.\n",
    "  - Often, the direction of play can be reversed to $-1$. In this case, the game moves from player $i$ to $i-1$, until it reaches $0$ at which point it wraps around to player $n-1$.\n",
    "- Each player has one of three moves:\n",
    "  - Increment the __count__ by one. In this case, the move passes to the next player in the current direction.\n",
    "  - Increment the __count__ by two. In this case, the direction of play is reversed. I.e, if we were moving from player i to i+1, we will now move from player i to i-1.\n",
    "  - Increment the __count__ by three. In this case, the direction of play remains unchanged but the next player in the current direction skips a turn.\n",
    "- If a player $j$ causes the count to be greater than or equal to $21$, the game stops and player $j$ loses. They are supposed to take a drink. For instance, if count is 19 and player plays a \"2\" or \"3\", they lose since count increased to 21 or more.\n",
    "- We will assume the drink is \"CSCI 3202 Professor\" brand koolaid (completely non-alcoholic but quite intoxicating nevertheless :-)\n",
    "  - Players imbibing too much of this koolaid risk going to graduate school in order to  become CS professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 0 starts with __count__ = 0 and __dir__ = +1.\n",
    "There are three players numbered  player 0, player 1 and player 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 0 counts one.\n",
    "  - New state is __count__ = 1, __dir__ = +1, player = 1.\n",
    "- Player 1 counts three.\n",
    "  - New state is __count__ = 4, __dir__ = +1, player = 0. Note: Player 2 skips a turn. The play wraps around to Player 0.\n",
    "- Player 0 counts three.\n",
    "  - New state is __count__ = 7, __dir__ = +1, player = 2. Note: Player 1 skips a turn and the play moves to Player 2.\n",
    "- Player 2 counts two.\n",
    "  - New State is __count__ = 9, __dir__ = -1, player = 1. Note: play reverses direction.\n",
    "- Player 1 counts three.\n",
    "  - New State is __count__ = 12,  __dir__ = -1, player = 2. Note: play wraps back to player 2, since player 0 skips a turn.\n",
    "- Player 2 counts two.\n",
    "  - New State is __count__ = 14, __dir__ = +1, player = 0.\n",
    "- Player 0 counts three.\n",
    "  - New State is __count__ = 17, __dir__ = +1, player = 2. \n",
    "- Player 2 counts three.\n",
    "  - New State is __count__ = 20,  __dir__ = +1, player = 1. \n",
    "- Player 1 counts two.\n",
    "  - New State is __count__ = 22. But since play crosses 21, player 1 loses the game and is forced to drink the Professor's CSCI 3202 Koolaid.\n"
